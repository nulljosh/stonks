# Autopilot - Claude Development Guide

## Project Vision
Autopilot is a high-alpha, low-latency financial terminal designed for extreme efficiency. It combines prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) with quantitative simulations and live market data into a unified dashboard optimized for minimal memory footprint and bandwidth usage.

## Architecture Goals
- **Memory**: Target <10MB runtime footprint ("The 10MB Dashboard")
- **Latency**: Sub-100ms data updates via Delta-Threshold algorithm
- **Efficiency**: Binary payloads, vectorized math, O(1) user input
- **Scalability**: Web app → C++ core → Custom RTOS (future)

## Current Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **APIs**: Polymarket, Kalshi, Yahoo Finance, News APIs
- **Math**: Monte Carlo, Black-Scholes (auto-parameterized)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Common Issues

### Localhost Polymarket API Proxy
**Problem:** Markets won't load on localhost but work on Vercel

**Cause:** Vercel deployment has authentication enabled, blocking proxy requests

**Solution:** Update `vite.config.js` to proxy directly to Polymarket API:
```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api/markets': {
      target: 'https://gamma-api.polymarket.com',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: true,
      rewrite: (path) => '/markets?closed=false&limit=50&order=volume24hr&ascending=false'
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** This proxy config only works in dev. Production uses Vercel serverless functions in `api/` folder.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Delta-Threshold Update Algorithm
**Purpose**: Minimize bandwidth by only updating UI when price moves beyond threshold.

**Logic**:
- Track last sent price `P_prev`
- Current price `P_curr`
- Threshold `δ = 0.5%`
- Update only if `|P_curr - P_prev| / P_prev > δ`

**Memory**: O(n) where n = number of tracked assets
**Latency**: O(1) per update check

---

### 2. Auto-Parameterized Monte Carlo
**Purpose**: Zero-input simulations using live market data.

**Parameters**:
- **Drift (μ)**: Derived from macro news sentiment analysis
- **Volatility (σ)**: Calculated from historical price variance
- **Paths**: 5,000 simulations
- **Horizon**: User-configurable (default 30 days)

**Optimization**:
- Vectorized operations (SIMD potential)
- Parallel path computation
- Cached news sentiment (15min TTL)

---

### 3. Binary Payload Compression
**Purpose**: Minimize API response sizes.

**Format**:
```
[timestamp (4 bytes)] [price (4 bytes float)] [volume (4 bytes)] [change% (2 bytes)]
= 14 bytes per data point vs 100+ bytes JSON
```

**Implementation**: Future enhancement (currently JSON)

---

## Real-World Trading Considerations

### API Latency
- **Simulation**: Instant execution
- **Reality**: 50-500ms API round-trip
- **Solution**: Pre-fetch with WebSocket, order book snapshots

### Liquidity & Slippage
- **Simulation**: Fill at mid-price
- **Reality**: Bid-ask spread, partial fills
- **Solution**: Model slippage as `f(volume, spread, volatility)`

### Rate Limits
- **Polymarket**: ~10 req/sec
- **Yahoo Finance**: ~2,000 req/hour
- **Solution**: Delta-Threshold + caching

### Paper Trading → Live
1. Test with paper trading API (TD Ameritrade, Alpaca)
2. Implement order confirmation UX
3. Add kill switch and position limits
4. Gradual capital allocation ($100 → $1k → ...)

---

## S&P 500 Coverage Plan

### Memory Budget Analysis
- **Per Stock**: ~100 bytes (ticker, price, change, volume)
- **500 Stocks**: ~50KB base
- **Historical (1Y)**: 252 days × 500 × 14 bytes = ~1.8MB
- **Total**: ~2MB for full S&P 500 coverage

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Add MAG7 + requested stocks (HIMS, PG, TGT, WMT)
2. **Phase 2**: Top 50 by market cap
3. **Phase 3**: Full S&P 500 with virtualized rendering
4. **Phase 4**: Custom stock input with symbol validation

---

## Broker Integration Roadmap

### TradingView Integration
- **Approach**: TradingView Webhooks → Autopilot API → Broker
- **Flow**: Alert trigger → REST endpoint → Order execution
- **Latency**: ~500ms end-to-end

### cTrader Integration
- **Approach**: cTrader Open API (REST + WebSocket)
- **Features**: Real-time quotes, order management, historical data
- **Use Case**: Forex and CFDs

### Wealthsimple Trade
- **Status**: No public API (as of 2025)
- **Alternative**: Screen scraping (unreliable) or wait for official API
- **Recommended**: Use IBKR, Alpaca, or Tradier instead

### Interactive Brokers (Recommended)
- **API**: TWS API (most robust)
- **Features**: Stocks, options, futures, forex, crypto
- **Latency**: Sub-50ms market data
- **Liquidity**: Direct market access

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Current (Web App)
- React dashboard
- API integrations
- Basic simulations

### Phase 2: C++ Core
- Rewrite compute-heavy modules (Monte Carlo, data processing)
- WebAssembly bridge to React frontend
- 10x performance improvement

### Phase 3: Custom RTOS

- Sub-millisecond tick-to-trade
- Custom kernel for order routing

### Phase 4: White Paper
- Publish algorithms and optimizations
- Academic validation of models
- Open-source efficiency techniques

## Meme Culture

**Nothing Ever Happens**:
- UI should only alert when macro events ACTUALLY break the status quo
- Silent by default
- Big bold alerts for >3% market moves
- "Something happened" banner when VIX spikes

## UI Skills

Opinionated constraints for building better interfaces with agents.

### Stack
- MUST use Tailwind CSS defaults (spacing, radius, shadows) before custom values
- MUST use `motion/react` (formerly `framer-motion`) when JavaScript animation is required
- SHOULD use `tw-animate-css` for entrance and micro-animations in Tailwind CSS
- MUST use `cn` utility (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) for class logic

### Components
- MUST use accessible component primitives for anything with keyboard or focus behavior (`Base UI`, `React Aria`, `Radix`)
- MUST use the project's existing component primitives first
- NEVER mix primitive systems within the same interaction surface
- SHOULD prefer [`Base UI`](https://base-ui.com/react/components) for new primitives if compatible with the stack
- MUST add an `aria-label` to icon-only buttons
- NEVER rebuild keyboard or focus behavior by hand unless explicitly requested

### Interaction
- MUST use an `AlertDialog` for destructive or irreversible actions
- SHOULD use structural skeletons for loading states
- NEVER use `h-screen`, use `h-dvh`
- MUST respect `safe-area-inset` for fixed elements
- MUST show errors next to where the action happens
- NEVER block paste in `input` or `textarea` elements

### Animation
- NEVER add animation unless it is explicitly requested
- MUST animate only compositor props (`transform`, `opacity`)
- NEVER animate layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`)
- SHOULD avoid animating paint properties (`background`, `color`) except for small, local UI (text, icons)
- SHOULD use `ease-out` on entrance
- NEVER exceed `200ms` for interaction feedback
- MUST pause looping animations when off-screen
- MUST respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- NEVER introduce custom easing curves unless explicitly requested
- SHOULD avoid animating large images or full-screen surfaces

### Typography
- MUST use `text-balance` for headings and `text-pretty` for body/paragraphs
- MUST use `tabular-nums` for data
- SHOULD use `truncate` or `line-clamp` for dense UI
- NEVER modify `letter-spacing` (`tracking-`) unless explicitly requested

### Layout
- MUST use a fixed `z-index` scale (no arbitrary `z-x`)
- SHOULD use `size-x` for square elements instead of `w-x` + `h-x`

### Performance
- NEVER animate large `blur()` or `backdrop-filter` surfaces
- NEVER apply `will-change` outside an active animation
- NEVER use `useEffect` for anything that can be expressed as render logic

### Design
- NEVER use gradients unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use purple or multicolor gradients
- NEVER use glow effects as primary affordances
- SHOULD use Tailwind CSS default shadow scale unless explicitly requested
- MUST give empty states one clear next action
- SHOULD limit accent color usage to one per view
- SHOULD use existing theme or Tailwind CSS color tokens before introducing new ones
